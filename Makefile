# Comments in this file are targeted only to the developer, do not
# expect to learn how to build the kernel reading this file.

# o Do not use make's built-in rules and variables
#   (this increases performance and avoids hard-to-debug behaviour);
# o Look for make include files relative to root of kernel src

# We are using a recursive build, so we need to do a little thinking
# to get the ordering right.
#
# Most importantly: sub-Makefiles should only ever modify files in
# their own directory. If in some directory we have a dependency on
# a file in another dir (which doesn't happen often, but it's often
# unavoidable when linking the built-in.o targets which finally
# turn into vmlinux), we will call a sub make in that other dir, and
# after that we are sure that everything which is in that other dir
# is now up to date.
#
# The only cases where we need to modify files which have global
# effects are thus separated out and done before the recursive
# descending is started. They are now explicitly listed as the
# prepare rule.

# Beautify output
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Normally, we echo the whole command before executing it. By making
# that echo $($(quiet)$(cmd)), we now have the possibility to set
# $(quiet) to choose other forms of output instead, e.g.
#
#         quiet_cmd_cc_o_c = Compiling $(RELDIR)/$@
#         cmd_cc_o_c       = $(CC) $(c_flags) -c -o $@ $<
#
# If $(quiet) is empty, the whole command will be printed.
# If it is set to "quiet_", only the short version will be printed.
# If it is set to "silent_", nothing will be printed at all, since
# the variable $(silent_cmd_cc_o_c) doesn't exist.
#
# A simple variant is to prefix commands with $(Q) - that's useful
# for commands that shall be hidden in non-verbose mode.
#
#	$(Q)ln $@ :<
#
# If KBUILD_VERBOSE equals 0 then the above command will be hidden.
# If KBUILD_VERBOSE equals 1 then the above command is displayed.
#
# To put more focus on warnings, be less verbose as default
# Use 'make V=1' to see the full commands
